#Overview of applications 

1. Readers World :
This application was designed to keep a track record of books in the bibliophile community. we read books and so do other folks, what do we do when we finish reading one?
Piling up books in our bookshef. 
Well we can do something more interesting, exchange yours with someone else's and read a new one now !.. 
But the community is too big to be handled and managed right ? here's a solution to the problem, I created a desktop application
 a. Which displays the books, you have alongwith their authors 
 b. Lets you add another book if you buy one
 c. Lets you keep a record of the book if you have borrowed/exchanged with some one along with the borrower's and owner's contact details.
